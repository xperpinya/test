#FEW TERMS-

DTD - Document type definition - The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly. HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

SGML - SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a standard for how to specify a document markup language or tag set. Such a specification is itself a document type definition (DTD). SGML is not in itself a document language, but a description of how to specify one.
